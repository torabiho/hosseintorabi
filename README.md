This is my personal website that I have built using MongoDB, Express, React,
and Node. I have followed a modular paradigm by composing functions and
assembling components where each piece has its own responsibility. I have
also applied the separation of concerns principle by creating a 3-layer
architecture in the backend: Controller, Service and data access layers.
